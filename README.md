## Introduction to AdventAI

AdventAI is an initiative from Toolhouse that blends the festive spirit of Christmas through December with daily challenges designed for AI enthusiasts.

Participants unlock a new app daily that they can use, configure, and distribute or even monetize. Each app bridges the gap between AI and real-time functions with the use of Tools.

> [!NOTE]
> Tools are serverless functions that run on the Toolhouse infrastructure, and empower LLMs with new functionalities like scraping the internet, a particular website, or sending emails.
